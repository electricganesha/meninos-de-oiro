# Meninos-De-Oiro Website

## Concept
We developed a website for Portuguese NGO Meninos de Oiro, a NGO based in Azeit√£o that focuses on giving support to children, victims of violence or in precarious situations. We developed this website using the MEAN stack, which allowed us to create a pretty dynamic back-office, where the users can very easily change, add or remove content, upload pictures, and many other features. The whole design and development was done at PUSH.
The project was never concluded and ended up not going into production.

## Tech
The website was developed using the MEAN stack : MongoDB + Express + Node.js + Angular.js
